# What are Computation and Information?

**objectives**: an attempt at unpacking in layman's terms what computation and information are.

**def computation¹**: the **transformation** of **sequences of symbols** by **precise rules**(Konrad, 2015:6)

- symbols = {1,0,\*,{,;,<,>,...}
  - example sequences:
    - 11010
    - ;\*>{11}  
      i.e. any sequence of the valid symbols
- precise rules = steps to follow

**def computation²**: The **evolution process** of some environment, by a **sequence of "simple, local" steps** (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy).

**plain english**:
- **def computation**: a list of steps to do something
- **def compute**: to do/run a computation.

**def information**: TBD

**formal classification scheme**:
