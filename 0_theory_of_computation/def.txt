topics relationship (Yanofsky, 2021):
    1_formal_languages_and_automata_theory => defines computers and languages they understand.
                        |
                        |
                        V
    0_models_of_computation = defines ways to compute and what our computers can/cannot compute.
                        |     defines how to do/run a list of steps AND
                        |       which lists of steps we can/can't do/run.
                        V
    2_computational_complexity_and_cryptography = defines the time and space/memory required to compute.
                        |                         defines how much time and space is required
                        |                           to do/run a list of steps.
                        V
    3_design_and_analysis_of_algorithms => defines how to make effective and efficient computations.
