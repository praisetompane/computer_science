FO = First Out

    Of importance is the FO
        the next thing to work on/with

LI |  FI = Last In | First In

    The qualifier for FO
        i.e. who is FO applied to.
            who is the First One Out


Queue: FIFO : First In First Out
                The First item In is the First item Out

Stack: LIFO : Last In First Out
                The Last item In is the First item Out

pattern: {entrance_time}{exit_time}
NB: Of importance if the exit_time, 
        because that's the next thing to compute on/with.
entrance_time = {FI, LI}
exit_time = {FO}

Q: Could we have?
    LILO
    FILO

    These are equivalent to the existing:
        i.e. LILO ≡ FIFO
             FILO ≡ LIFO

Q: Could we have:
    FO = First Out
    MI = Middle In
        def Middle In?
    MIFI = Middle In First Out
