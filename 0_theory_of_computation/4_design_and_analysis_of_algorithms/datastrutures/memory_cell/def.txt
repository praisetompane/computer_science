What is it?
    A point in time and space in a computer
        where you can store values

    Fundamental data structure that all the data structures are built on top of.

Performance Analysis:
    How fast is it to perform the operation? (i.e. Time Complexity)
        => Measured in terms of the number of steps it takes to complete the operation

    Read: Looking up something from a particular spot in the data structure
        Steps = 1
        O(1)
    
    Search: Looking for a particular value in the data structure
        Steps = 1
        O(1)

    Insert: Adding a value to the data structure 
        Steps = 1
        O(1)

    Delete: Removing a value from the data structure
        Steps = 1
        O(1)
