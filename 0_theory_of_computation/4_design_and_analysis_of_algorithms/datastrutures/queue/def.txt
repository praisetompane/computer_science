What is it?
    A variable length
        list of values 
    
        that only supports:
            adding elements to the end of the list
            removing element at the top of the list
            reading element at the top of the list
    Therefore: An access pattern for a list of values
    i.e. FIFO = First In, First Out

ADT
    enqueue
    dequeue
    peek
    isempty

Performance Analysis:
    How fast is it to perform the operation? (i.e. Time Complexity)
        => Measured in terms of the number of steps it takes to complete the operation

    Read: Looking up something from a particular spot in the data structure
        Constraint: Can only read at the top spot
        Steps = 
            1 step = O(1)
    
    Search: Looking for a particular value in the data structure
        Steps = 

    Insert: Adding a value to the structure 
        Constraint: Can only add to the end of the list
        Steps = 
            2 steps to reappoint pointers = O(1)
  
    Delete: Removing a value from the data structure
        Constraint: Can only remove from the top spot
        Steps = 
            3 steps to reappoint pointers = O(1)
