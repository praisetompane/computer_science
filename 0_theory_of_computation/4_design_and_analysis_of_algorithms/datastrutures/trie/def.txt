What is it?
    Type of graph, specifically a type of tree(n-ary tree).
    AKA prefix tree
    Has the following properties:
        has an empty root node (i.e. an empty set)
        It is set of things(nodes)
        Each node has:
            a set of nodes which represent valid next nodes
                where set size <= ALPHABET_IZE[Number of discrete things(nodes)]
            an indicator[Boolean, or special child node] of whether it is a final node in some valid sequence

    More concrete example:
        node = letter in English language
        valid sequence = word in English language


Performance Analysis:
    How fast is it to perform the operation? (i.e. Time Complexity)
        => Measured in terms of the number of steps it takes to complete the operation

    Read: Looking up something from a particular spot in the data structure
        i.e. Looking up if a string is a valid prefix
        Steps = O(K)
            K = length of string
    
    Search: Looking for a particular value in the data structure
        Steps = 

    Insert: Adding a value to the data structure 
        Steps = 

    Delete: Removing a value from the data structure
        Steps =
