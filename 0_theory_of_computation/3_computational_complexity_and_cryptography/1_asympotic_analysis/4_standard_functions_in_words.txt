log₂n       :

n           : for every item in a list
                visit it once
                    to solve the problem
nlog₂n      :

    N²      : for every item in a list, 
                combine it individually
                    with every item in the list
                        to solve the problem.
                
                given 10 items:
                    every item will be combined with the 9 other items to generate a result.
                    Combinations:
                        10^2 = 100
                        10 * 9 item combinations = 90, since an item does get combined with itself, hence the 90

                    with every item in the list
                        to solve the problem.

2ⁿ          : addition of one element to the input
                doubles the number of steps
                    to solve the problem.
