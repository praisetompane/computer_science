def: theory to classify problems into two categories (Sipser, 2012:3):
    - SOLVABLE by computers (i.e. computable)
    - NOT SOLVABLE by computers (i.e. incomputable)

    example classification of problems (Sipser. 2012:2):
        - add two numbers 1 + 5: SOLVABLE = computable
        - prove that a mathematical statement is True or False: NOT SOLVABLE = incomputable

Q: Can define new models of computation that can compute the current incomputable(UNSOLVABLE) problems?
